# Lattice

A domain neutral semantic framework for representing governing instruments (contracts, protocols, agreements, etc) and the obligations, eligibility conditions, and lifecycle behaviours they define, as structured, queryable, versioned graphs.

---

## Overview

As a project, Lattice has been organised to allow users to pick and choose the parts they want without depending on everything. Lattice provides ontologies, libraries, deployable services, and control-plane infrastructure the way a framework does, and is not a standalone application.

An adopter is free to take some of it, all of it, or build around it entirely, and the parts they do take, they configure for their own domain and their own operational constraints.

| Part | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Ontology Substrates | The ontologies in the substrate layers can be used together or standalone, to develop _domain ontologies_ with consistent semantics inherited from these upper ontologies. |
| Applied Ontology Layers | Pre-built _domain ontologies_ with a focus on a specifc subject area, industry, or goal/usage |
| Tools | Tools that operate on both the internal substrates (upper ontologies), applied ontologies, and a user's own _domain ontologies_ |
| Platform (design time) | Capabilities that offer design support and administrative tooling for users of Lattice |
| Platform (runtime) | Software infrastructure, services, and applications that support building complex ontology-based solutions on top of Lattice |

### Ontology Layers

**MORK (Mapping Ontological & Representational Knowledge)** used to map source material — structured data (schemas, records, API specifications, etc) and unstructured wordings (documents, clauses, free text) — onto a target domain ontology's T-box & R-Box, using Formal Concept Analysis over the co-occurrence structure of previously mapped source material to propose alignment. MORK as a general-purpose mapping vocabulary, based on SKOS.

The layers described below are one family of mapping target, but not the only possible one. MORK's semantic vocabulary and target declarations live under `ontology/mork/`, while its Python implementation lives under `tools/mork/`. LATTICE uses MORK as the reference way of populating its own layers.

**LATTICE (Concept Lattice of Domain Ontology Layers)** provides the semantic substrate MORK's output lands in - designed to be extended by particular subject domains in order to be used in industry-specific ways.

**SPC (Subject-oriented Process Calculus)**  provides a formal mechanism for describing orchestration between agents (human, AI, or computational), whose data has been mapped in by MORK and whose roles, obligations, and eligibility are modelled in LATTICE. Where LATTICE's Behaviour layer models what state something is in and what can cause it to change, SPC is concerned with the live, session-typed exchange between agents that drives those changes — giving that exchange a formal contract to align to, grounded in the same ontology, rather than an ad hoc protocol. SPC has a substantial standalone ontology under `ontology/spc/`, with Python and Erlang implementations under `tools/spc/`. It is not yet integrated with the layers below: it uses a placeholder namespace and declares no `projection/` contract to any of them. Treat it as a separate, pre-integration body of work rather than part of the dependency graph described below.

**Persistence (the Data Access Layer, `dal:`)** lets an adopter select, per class or per deployment of their own applied ontology, which of the portable RDF/SPARQL patterns in [`docs/architecture/rdf-sparql-patterns-guide.md`](docs/architecture/rdf-sparql-patterns-guide.md) apply: aggregate boundary, concurrency, ordering grain, receipt model, meta topology, and uniqueness. The framework-neutral [IRI and Identity Patterns](docs/architecture/iri-identity-patterns.md) guide defines a future identity-profile dimension for the same configuration model. It is a cross-cutting substrate, not a layer — it targets classes, graphs, and shapes by IRI reference only, and no layer imports it or is imported by it. The vocabulary and SHACL shapes live under `ontology/persistence/`; a design-time-only compiler (no store SPI, no live backend) that turns a selection into generated SPARQL lives under `tools/persistence/`. See [ADR-A78](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-A78-persistence-profile-substrate-and-aggregate-boundaries.md), [ADR-A79](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-A79-persistence-compiler-toolchain.md), and [ADR-A82](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-A82-framework-neutral-identity-pattern-selection.md).

#### Ontology Layers

LATTICE is organised as seven layers, each an independent OWL/SHACL/SKOS module:

| Layer | Kind | What it models |
|---|---|---|
| **Foundation** | Substrate | Identity, versioning, provenance and evidence, governance state, temporal scoping. |
| **Vocabulary** | Substrate | The governed mechanism by which external, domain-specific concept schemes get bound into the other layers without touching their core specifications. |
| **Quantification** | Substrate | Declared value spaces, quantities, ordered values, bounds, ranges, conversion, granularity, and recurrence — the mechanism behind any magnitude, interval, or ordinal comparison the other layers need. |
| **Party** | Substrate | 	Actors, the roles they occupy, and the direction and composition of obligation between them (e.g., modelling independently capped shares, joint obligation with a right of recourse, delegated accountability, or contingent role occupancy). |
| **Eligibility** | Substrate | admissibility criteria (conditions, unresolved questions, and decisions). |
| **Behaviour** | Substrate | State, transition, trigger, and effect, including a usable `Sequential` allowance profile. `Proportional` allowance semantics and reset edge cases remain explicitly deferred. |
| **Instrument** | Applied domain ontology | A primary domain ontology built on the substrates, giving the generic shape of a governing document, e.g., Provision → Obligation → Qualifier. |

Instrument is a first layer building on the substrates. A different applied domain ontology (e.g., a device's operational lifecycle, access-control entitlement system, asset maintenance schedule, etc) could sit atop Instrument or even replace it, composing with the same Party, Eligibility, and Behaviour mechanisms through its own `projection/` contracts, without touching any of the core specifications.

Every mechanism in a layer's specification should be usable without knowing what industry or domain is consuming it. See `ontology/examples/` for the worked instances.

### Repository Layout

Each layer directory follows the same internal template, present in whole or in the parts that layer actually needs:

```
<layer>/
├── README.md
├── spec/          # normative T-box
├── shapes/
│   ├── structural.ttl    # SHACL property shapes — local, per-instance
│   ├── constraints.ttl   # SHACL-SPARQL — whole-graph conditions
│   └── rules.ttl         # SHACL-SPARQL rules that materialise derived facts
├── vocab/          # mechanism-intrinsic enumerations only, never including business vocabulary
├── projection/     # the layer's declared contracts to/from other layers
├── execution/      # generated runtime artefacts, where a layer needs one,
│                   #   plus the docs governing how they're regenerated
├── examples/       # single-layer worked examples
└── test/           # the layer's own shape and rule tests
```

Governance is deliberately separate from every layer it checks — `ontology/governance/` runs over the union graph rather than living inside any one module, enforcing scheme-contract compliance, deprecation posture, and cross-layer parity in CI.

Compiled artefacts live under `execution/`, being generated from `spec/`, `shapes/`, `vocab/`, and `projection/` by deterministic, reproducible processes or code (to be regenerated on source change per that layer's `invalidation-policy.md`).

The `tools/` folder holds reference implementations handling compilation. It's licensed separately from everything else in the tree — see [Licensing](#licensing).

## How the layers interact

```
foundation
    └── vocabulary
            └── quantification
                    └── party
                            ├── eligibility
                            │       └── instrument
                            └── behaviour   (imports instrument, eligibility, party, quantification)

mork — targets any layer
spc  — standalone today; not yet imported by, or importing, any layer above
spc  — leverages domain ontology axioms to form session types once a separate integration effort defines the needed contracts
```

A few commmon compositions are worth noting:

- **Guard calls Eligibility.** A Behaviour transition's guard condition is, in the general case, an Eligibility decision: conditions, unresolved questions, and results.
- **Effects write into Instrument or Party.** A transition firing can create or modify an Obligation, or populate a Role Occupancy that was contingent until that moment.
- **Role Occupancy is itself stateful.** The same State/Trigger/Effect apparatus that governs an Obligation's status governs whether a Role is currently occupied at all — this is what allows a party who is not connected to an instrument be bound in later, by the instrument's own design.

## Developer Setup / Getting Started

### Confirm required tools

```bash
mise --version
mise doctor
mise install
mise ls

mise exec -- python --version
mise exec -- node --version
mise exec -- java -version
mise exec -- mvn --version
mise exec -- elixir --version
mise exec -- erl -eval 'io:format("~p~n", [erlang:system_info(otp_release)]), halt().'
```

### Check the new repository structure

```bash
mise run topology:preflight
test -d ontology
test -d tools
test -d tools/mork
test -d tools/mork_compilers
test -d tools/surface
test -d tools/persistence
test -d tools/spc/python
test -d tools/spc/erlang
test -d workers
test -d platform
test -d apps
test -d contracts
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
mise run bootstrap
```

This installs the root Python dependencies, worker dependencies, Yarn workspace, etc.

### Run aggregate repository checks

```bash
mise run check
```

This runs:

```bash
mise run check:python-root
mise run check:workers
mise run check:java
mise run check:frontend
mise run check:spc
```

### Build and test all frontend workspaces

```bash
mise exec -- yarn check
mise exec -- yarn build
mise exec -- yarn test
```

If Playwright reports missing browsers:

```bash
mise exec -- yarn workspace @lattice/mork-review-workbench exec playwright install
mise exec -- yarn workspace @lattice/surface-contract-studio exec playwright install
mise exec -- yarn test
```

### Validate MORK

```bash
mise exec -- python -m pip install -e tools/mork -e tools/mork_compilers -e tools/surface
mise exec -- python -m pytest tools/mork/src -q
mise exec -- python -m compileall -q tools/mork/src tools/mork_compilers/src tools/surface/src
```

### Validate the persistence compiler

```bash
mise run bootstrap:persistence
mise run check:persistence
```

Compiles `ontology/persistence`'s own worked examples, runs the resolver/validator/capability/boundary unit tests, the injection corpus, the determinism checks, and the Python architecture-policy checks, and validates every example fixture against `ontology/persistence/shapes/constraints.ttl`. See [`tools/persistence/README.md`](tools/persistence/README.md).

### Work on the docs site locally (Jekyll)

Not part of the default `mise run bootstrap` — Ruby/Jekyll are only needed when editing GitHub Pages content under `docs/`:

```bash
mise run bootstrap:jekyll
mise run serve:jekyll
```

`bootstrap:jekyll` installs an isolated Ruby (via `mise`, scoped to this task only) and the exact gem set `Gemfile.lock` pins, into `docs/vendor/bundle` (gitignored, never committed). `mise run clean` (or `mise run clean:docs` alone) removes `docs/vendor/`, `docs/.bundle/`, and any local Jekyll build output (`docs/_site/`, `.jekyll-cache/`) without touching `docs/Gemfile`/`docs/Gemfile.lock`.

### Validate SPC Python

```bash
mise exec -- python -m pip install -e 'tools/spc/python[dev]'
mise exec -- python -m compileall -q tools/spc/python/src
```

### Validate SPC Erlang

```bash
cd tools/spc/erlang
mise exec -- mix deps.get
mise exec -- mix test
cd ../..
```

### Run the complete test task

```bash
mise run test
```

### Build the Java platform cleanly

```bash
mise exec -- mvn -f platform/pom.xml clean verify
```

Focused Surface regression gate:

```bash
mise exec -- mvn -f platform/pom.xml -pl surface-workflow -am test
```

### Check Docker-backed services

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
docker compose -f deployment/compose/docker-compose.yml config
mise run services:up
docker compose -f deployment/compose/docker-compose.yml ps
mise run services:down
```

The service checks confirm container startup and reachability. They do not replace end-to-end integration tests.

The canonical active documentation locations are `plans`, `status`, and `review`.
