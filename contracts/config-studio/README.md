# Configuration Studio contracts

The data contracts between the [Configuration Studio](../../apps/config-studio)'s browser code, its [service](../../platform/config-studio-service) and its [worker](../../workers/README.md#configuration-studio-jobs-adr-a136) ([ADR-A136](../../docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-A136-configuration-studio.md)). A proof of concept, so nothing outside the studio may depend on them.

Every body is RDF. The terms are in [`studio-vocabulary.ttl`](studio-vocabulary.ttl), prefix `cst:`, and the configurations themselves use `dal:` and `srf:` unchanged. The one JSON document is [`amqp-topology.json`](amqp-topology.json).

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `studio-vocabulary.ttl` | workspaces, samples, jobs, job status, artefacts and gaps |
| `amqp-topology.json` | the exchange, the job queue and the dead-letter queue, declared identically by the service and the worker |
| `samples/samples.ttl` | the samples, each a list of repository files |
| `samples/lending-baseline.ttl` | a baseline for the lending sample, which the persistence example it pairs with does not declare |

## Graphs

| Graph IRI | Written by | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `urn:lattice:studio:ws:{ws}` | service | the `cst:Workspace` node, whose IRI is the graph's: `rdfs:label`, `cst:createdAt`, `cst:modifiedAt`, `cst:baselineGraph`, and `cst:{name}Revision` for each graph name below. A revision the description lacks reads as 0 |
| `urn:lattice:studio:ws:{ws}:baseline:{n}` | service, once | baseline revision n, from 1 |
| `urn:lattice:studio:ws:{ws}:{name}` | service | the saved configuration `{name}`: `vocabulary` (`voc:` and `skos:`), `quantification` (`qnt:`), `eligibility` (`elg:`), `persistence` (`dal:`) or `surface` (`srf:`) |
| `urn:lattice:studio:job:{job}` | service, then worker | the `cst:Job` node, whose IRI is the graph's |
| `urn:lattice:studio:job:{job}:input` | service, once | the configuration as submitted |

`{ws}` and `{job}` are lower-case UUIDs.

## HTTP

Every request and response body is RDF in UTF-8, unless the table says otherwise: `text/turtle` by default, or `application/rdf+xml`. A request body may be either, named by its `Content-Type`. A response is RDF/XML when the request's `Accept` ranks `application/rdf+xml` above `text/turtle` (a range without `q` counts 1, `*/*` favours Turtle), and every RDF response carries `Vary: Accept`. RDF/XML is written plain, one `rdf:Description` per subject, so an XSLT reads one regular shape. A graph whose predicate RDF/XML cannot write, one whose IRI does not end in an XML name, answers `406` in RDF/XML and stays readable as Turtle. An ETag names a graph's revision, the same in either syntax. A request body with another content type is refused with `415`, a body over 5 MiB with `413`, a body that does not parse, or RDF/XML that declares a DTD, with `400`, an unknown workspace or job with `404`.

| Method and path | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | | `200`, `text/plain`, `ok` |
| `GET /api/vocabulary` | | `200`, the `dal:`, `srf:`, `fnd:` and `voc:` specifications and vocabularies merged, with an `ETag`. `304` for a matching `If-None-Match` |
| `GET /api/samples` | | `200`, every `cst:Sample` with its label and comment |
| `GET /api/samples/{id}` | | `200`, the sample's files merged into one graph |
| `GET /api/workspaces` | | `200`, every workspace's description |
| `POST /api/workspaces` | the baseline. `Slug` header, percent-encoded UTF-8, is the label | `201`, `Location: /api/workspaces/{ws}`, the description |
| `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}` | | `200`, the description |
| `DELETE /api/workspaces/{ws}` | | `204`. Drops the description, every baseline revision and both configurations |
| `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/graphs/{name}` | `name` is `baseline` or a configuration's name | `200`, the graph, `ETag: "{revision}"` |
| `PUT /api/workspaces/{ws}/graphs/{name}` | the new graph. `If-Match: "{revision}"` is required | `204`, `ETag` of the new revision. `428` without `If-Match`, `412` when it is not the current revision, `422` when a subject belongs to another part by the rule the browser's import uses (a named subject belongs to the first of persistence, surface, eligibility, quantification and vocabulary whose namespace its type or predicates use, a SKOS concept or scheme to vocabulary, anything else to the baseline, and a blank node to the subject that refers to it). A baseline is written as a new revision graph |
| `POST /api/workspaces/{ws}/jobs?kind={validate,compile}&target={name}` | the configuration to check, which need not be saved, and the other configurations beside it as context | `202`, `Location: /api/jobs/{job}`, the job graph. `400` for another kind or target. Every configuration validates. `eligibility`, `persistence` and `surface` compile |
| `GET /api/workspaces/{ws}/jobs` | | `200`, the description of each compile job of the workspace: status, kind, target and times, without report or artefacts |
| `GET /api/jobs/{job}` | | `200`, the job graph |
| `DELETE /api/jobs/{job}` | | `204`. Drops the job graph and its input graph |

Every response carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and every `/api` response `Cache-Control: no-store`, except the vocabulary, which is revalidated by its `ETag`. No response carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

## Jobs

The service writes the job graph and publishes the job's IRI. The message body is that IRI in UTF-8, `content_type` `text/plain`, persistent, routed with `lattice.studio.jobs` on exchange `lattice.studio`. The worker refuses, without requeuing, a body that is not `urn:lattice:studio:job:` followed by a lower-case UUID, and the broker dead-letters it.

As written by the service:

```turtle
<urn:lattice:studio:job:{job}> a cst:Job ;
    cst:kind cst:Validate ;                     # or cst:Compile
    cst:target cst:Persistence ;                # or cst:Vocabulary, cst:Quantification, cst:Eligibility, cst:Surface
    cst:workspace <urn:lattice:studio:ws:{ws}> ;
    cst:configGraph <urn:lattice:studio:job:{job}:input> ;
    cst:baselineGraph <urn:lattice:studio:ws:{ws}:baseline:{n}> ;
    cst:status cst:Queued ;
    cst:submittedAt "2026-10-27T10:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```

The worker replaces the whole job graph twice, keeping every triple above but `cst:status`. When it starts, it sets `cst:status cst:Running` and adds `cst:startedAt`. When it ends, it sets `cst:Succeeded` or `cst:Failed` and adds `cst:finishedAt`, and then:

- for `cst:Failed`, `cst:failureMessage`, saying why the job could not run, for example a missing input graph. A configuration that does not validate or compile is not a failure.
- for `cst:Succeeded`, `cst:conforms`, and `cst:report` naming an `sh:ValidationReport` in the same graph. Its `sh:result`s are pySHACL's for a validation. For a compilation they are the compiler's refusal, an `sh:Violation`, and its warnings, each `sh:Warning`, each with `cst:code` the compiler's name for it, `sh:resultMessage`, and `sh:focusNode` where the compiler names a node.
- for a successful compilation, one `cst:artefact` per file, with `cst:path`, `cst:mediaType`, `cst:content` and `cst:group`. For persistence these are `compiled-profile.ttl` and each SPARQL file `instantiate` writes, grouped by target. For surface, each file `compile` writes, grouped by contract.
- for a persistence compilation, one `cst:gap` per entry of `python -m persistence gaps`, with `cst:group`, `cst:obligation` and `cst:message`.
- for a persistence validation, the compiler's refusal and warnings too, since the `dal:` shapes do not see a `dal:DataAccessProfile` that declares several dimensions.
- for a vocabulary validation, one `cst:resolution` per scheme contract, time segment and set of active scopes, with `cst:contract`, `cst:validFrom` and `cst:validTo` where bounded, `cst:context` per active scope, `cst:outcome`, and `cst:scheme` and `cst:binding`, or `cst:tied` for a conflict, as `tools/vocabulary` resolves it.
- for an eligibility validation, each condition compiled by `tools/mork_compilers`, its refusal an `sh:Violation` with `cst:code` `IRCompileError`. One `cst:expansion` per member of a concept condition's resolved scheme, with `cst:condition`, `cst:concept` and `cst:decision`. One `cst:testResult` per `elg:Question`, decided by the condition's compiled SPARQL, with `cst:question`, `cst:condition`, `cst:decision`, `cst:diagnostic` when Undetermined, and `cst:passed` against the question's `cst:expectedDecision`. A failed test is an `sh:Violation` with `cst:code` `TestFailed`, and makes the job not conform. A condition or question may name `cst:resolutionTime` and `cst:resolutionScope`, and otherwise resolves at the job's submission time with no scope.
- for an eligibility compilation, `decision.rq` and `shapes.ttl` for each condition and admission profile, grouped by its local name.

The configuration a job checks is its input graph. The worker reads a missing baseline graph as empty, since the store keeps no empty graph, and fails a job whose input graph is missing.

Running a job twice gives the same graph but for its times, so a redelivered message is harmless.
